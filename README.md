 Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-scikit-learn
 
 Recognizing handwritten text is a problem that can be traced back to the first automatic
machines that needed to recognize individual characters in handwritten documents.
Think about, for example, the ZIP codes on letters at the post office and the automation
needed to recognize these five digits. Perfect recognition of these codes is necessary in
order to sort mail automatically and efficiently.
Included among the other applications that may come to mind is OCR (Optical
Character Recognition) software. OCR software must read handwritten text, or pages of
printed books, for general electronic documents in which each character is well
defined.
